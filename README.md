# streebog
Streebog  is a cryptographic hash function defined in the Russian national standard GOST R 34.11-2018 (previously 34.11-2012) Information Technology – Cryptographic Information Security – Hash Function. It was created to replace an obsolete GOST hash function defined in the old standard GOST R 34.11-94.
Now implemented 256-bit and 512-bit versions of Streebog via Streebog::Hash() function
Current goal: implement collision attack on it and fail it
